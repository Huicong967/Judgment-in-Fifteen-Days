Day 1 Prison,"The iron gate is closed, and the voice sinks into the stone wall, like a slow prayer.
You are numbered E-9 and thrown into this underground sanctorium called the Prison of Silentprayer.
The light comes only from the ash lamp embedded in the stone wall, a cold flame tempered with sinners bone meal.
There is an unsealed medicine bottle in the corner, with a logo that is in the same vein as the alchemy inscription in your memory-you recognize the medicine, which can temporarily stabilize the blood.
In this silent spell, you must decide what you want to greet your first night.",Take an oath of anger and strike the iron bars.,Silent Observation,To hide wisdom with madness,"""I was wronged! Let me out--!""
Your roar echoed through the stone walls, and the jailer turned back with a sneer on his face.
The sound of the stick falling is clearer than your heartbeat. Wooden iron-studded poles split the air and hit you on the shoulder.
The pain blurs your vision, but it makes you see him clearly:
Next to the keychain at his waist hung a 1 cracked emblem pendant, the surface of which had been scratched and smoothed.
And at his knuckles, you caught a glimpse of the gray ointment oozing from the thick cracks in the cocoon. That's the pain-relieving cream you're familiar with, from the lower alchemy workshop.
You suddenly-this jailer has been suffering from old wounds for a long time, but he can't afford orthodox medicine.
When the stick shadow falls again, you grit your teeth and stop avoiding.
The smell of iron spreads in your mouth and you laugh instead.
""He's suffering, too.""","You lean against the damp stone wall and close your eyes.
The lamp flame trembled in the dust and moisture, and the air was as dull as a solution sealed in a medicine bottle.
You breathe slowly-the smell wakes you up in an instant: bitterwood, silver salt, warm lime, traces of solanine.
It is a basic neutralizing formula rarely used in alchemy drugs for long-term storage of volatile liquids.
This means that the air here is not natural, but a man-made stable environment.
Your heart is fiercely. The walls, floors, and vents of the prison are contaminated with medicinal properties.
It was never just a prison-it was a drug store or testing ground.
If the ""healing agent poisoning"" event stems from the tampering of the drug, then this underground area is most likely the original deployment site.
You open your eyes, the cold ash lamp flickering in the swaying mist, like a glimmer of light whose chemistry has not yet ended.","You looked up and laughed. Laughter echoed on the wet walls, like the ghost of a prisoner.
The jailer scolded ""madman"" and turned off the light and left.
In the shadow, a low and dumb voice gently asked, ""Alchemist, are you pretending to be crazy, do you want to save your life or the truth?""
You follow the sound, and the prisoners in the opposite prison are drawing blood on the wall.
On it were fuzzy red marks, not handwriting, but more like seven short horizontal marks rubbed out of the knuckles.
""I could feel the wind, but we had nowhere to run."" The man said
You reach down the gap in the wall and feel a slight airflow-the stone wall is not solid, but not enough to escape.
You look across to the dark prison and say nothing.","Strength -5

Day 2 dossier page missing,"Dawn did not come, only the echo of the iron gate.
The ash lamp is not extinguished, but you are awakened in 1 vague half-sleep.
Outside the door rang the sound of the bottom of the boot-it was the pace of the judgment deacon, slow and precise, as if each step was measuring the breath of the sinner.
He was dressed in a gray robe, the horns of which were wrapped with prayers of gold thread. His eyes are blind, but he sees everything.
The jailer Bram bent down to salute, but the deacon did not look at him, but said coldly, ""Prisoner E-9-sign your confession in the name of the holy book.""
The light outside the iron bar casts the document on the ground, and you see that it is a document written on divine prayer paper. Once signed, the ink will be swallowed by the holy array and become part of the ""holy scripture archives.
Your wrists are still chained,
He was waiting, the breathing of the lamp flame louder than the heartbeat in the darkness.","Agree to sign, peep at paperwork",Direct refusal,cross-examination,"You bow your head and take the feather pen. The smell of ink pierced the nasal cavity.
That's Night Shadow Ink. With silver salt and blood powder as the medium, can permanently imprint the signature spirit mark.
With a flick of your finger, you feel the temperature of the blood powder is not yet dry-that means the document has been tampered with elsewhere.
You catch a glimpse of a tiny line of pardon numbers printed on the paperwork, which is the bulk registration code used in the healing agent trials.
It's not just a 1 confession, it's a perjury that binds you to the poison experiment.
You sign your name with a fake trembling, while secretly scraping off a little ink with your fingernails and dripping into your palm,
The blood powder melts with your blood, and this document does carry the remnants of your alchemy mark. They used your old files.
At the moment of signing, you understand that what God wants is not your confession, but your handwriting.","You raise your head and look at the deacon.
""If this is God's will, why do we have to sign it?""
He leaned slightly, the emblem in his hand lit up with white light, cold as a knife.
A burning heat passes through your chest-it's not fire, it's an interrogation symbol carved into the bloodline.
""Man,"" he said, ""God has written the judgment, and your hand need only follow His pen.""
The holy emblem is pressed on your forehead, scorching your flesh.
Your hand was forced on the document by him, the feather pen was stuffed between your fingers, and the ink was mixed with blood.
""Sign it, mortal.""
You barely realize when you're moving your pen. When that last 1 stroke falls, the spell stops immediately.
The air returns to silence. The light of the holy emblem darkens, and your body loosens with it.
The chains are still shaking, but I don't know if it's the shaken metal or your still shaking hands.","""I didn't make that batch of healing agents."" Your voice is low and steady,
""But on the file is my handwriting, my number. If God knows all, He should know-that evidence of the crime is forged.""
The judging deacon turned the holy emblem slowly, and the light flowed between his fingers, as if playing with a silent sentence.
""Forged?"" he repeated the word in a tone of contempt as if he were listening to the 1 joke.
""Refined pharmacist."" He repeated the phrase softly, ""In the order of God, only prayer can heal the sick.
And you tried to imitate miracles by refining the liquid medicine with your hands.""
He paused, his voice so low that he could hardly hear it: ""If a mortal wants to heal a mortal, it is tantamount to blasphemy and unforgivable.""","Get the clue: the document is perjury, the ink contains the imprint of your old alchemy (the paperwork line advances)",Magic -5,Get a clue: The Vatican does not seem to allow mortals to refine medicine,,1,1,1,,,2,15,10,20,10,,
Day 3 group of rats,"On the third night, the iron gate remained, and the ash lamp was as yellow as molten iron.
Do you still remember yesterday's signature, the name that was forcibly written down burned in your mind.
A hoarse moan came from the cage opposite. The prisoner who whispered to you is bending over and struggling on the ground.
You hear the sound of metal crashing against bone.
The ash lamp flickered, and when the light fell again, he was curled up and no longer moving.
The rancid stench soon spread. Black rats follow the scent and crawl out of the gutter, their fur shining silver-the sheen contaminated by the drug.
You watched the clouds of rat shadows crawling over the bodies. The alchemist's instinct awakens in the body.
Mouse hair contains traces of silver salt reactants-it is the secondary alternative catalyst for pain relief ointment.
The rotten sores on the jailer Bram's arm, you know, he's using shoddy painkillers.
Without the use of orthodox painkillers, the wound is bound to be difficult to heal.
If you can make up for the missing pills, he'll owe you a 1. Here, kindness is worth more than the key.
So-you reach out and lean towards the body, which is not completely cold.","turn a blind eye, sit and rest",Observe the body,Shout to the jailer,"You close your eyes and don't look at the body.
The rodents interweave with the sound of dripping water into a strange rhythm, and the stench and blood interweave into a strange prayer.
You synchronize the breath with its rhythm, allowing the body to get used to the smell of death in the stench.
When you open your eyes again, your heartbeat is no longer disturbed by fear.","You hold your breath and observe the body through the bars.
The ash lamp shimmered, reflecting a distorted face.
The corners of the mouth were stained with black and purple blood, which was not corruption, but an acute poisoning reaction.
The skin on the chest is unnaturally dark blue, with blood vessels floating, such as the texture of being burned.
Your mind immediately returned to the workshop. That's a symptom of the failure of the trial production of the ""toxic healing agent--
Your heart is 1, he is indeed the experimenter who drank that batch of healing agents.
If this is a doped version of the drug, it means that someone deliberately changed the formula ratio during mass production.
This is not a mistake, but a tampering.","You step back a few steps and shout, ""This side is dead!""
The iron gate was opened and the jailer Bram walked in with his cane.
The rats were frightened and scattered, and he scolded low.
""Dead one? Just less food.""
He lifted the body, looked at it, and pushed it with his bare hands.
Poisonous blood spilled from the wound and splashed on his forearm, instantly popping black spots.
He growled 1 and took two steps backwards. You tried to remind him of ""poison"" and got hit in the shoulder with a backhand 1 stick.
""Shut up, heresy!""
He left in anger, leaving only the bodies and the rats that gradually came back.

Day 4 Cellmate Ryan,"In the middle of the night, the prison room smelled of tide and iron.
The ash lamp flickered, like a gasp.
You're thinking about how to get the other ingredients for the painkiller--
Suddenly, a tap came from the wall next door.
Three, pause, two -1 kind of rhythmic code.
A moment later, a hoarse voice came from the brick seam: ""You are the one who refines the medicine, aren't you?""
You didn't answer.
The voice smiled. ""Don't pretend. I know you can adjust medicine. The smell doesn't fool me.""
1 skinny fingers protruded from a crack in the wall and pushed in to 1 small packets of powder wrapped in oilcloth.
""Oil of fire."" he whispered.
""If you can make explosive potions, we may be able to boil the iron lock on the north side. I'll pick the door and you'll make the medicine.""
He called himself Ryan.
You couldn't see his face, you could only see those eyes in the remnant of the oil lamp-like 1 tired hound.
Ryan's tone was steady and almost gentle, but behind that peace you smelled some kind of danger.
In this prison, ""cooperation"" has never been a shared trust, but a calculation.",Agree to cooperate,To change the subject and probe into Rennes's past,Questioning Wren's motives,"You stared at the packet of oil powder, silver reflection jumping from the gap.
""Good."" You whisper. ""I'll adjust the medicine and you unlock it.""
From the other side of the wall came 1 chuckle, like the sound of a chain being cut. ""Smart choice.""
You mix a little oil powder into the bottom of the lamp, and the flame of the ash lamp becomes bright in an instant.
There was a sweet fishy smell in the air-a precursor to a deflagration reaction.
You smell freedom for the first time, and it carries danger and hope.","""Why are you in jail?""
There was silence on the other side of the wall for a while, and there was a 1 chuckle.
""Me?&hellip; Stealing."" His voice sounded almost self-deprecating.
""at that time, I worked as a handyman in the monastery. the officials of the gods would leave half a bottle of 'holy wine' after the banquet, so I conveniently took several bottles. as a result, I was caught on the spot. the holy wine was a sacrificial product, which was untouchable to ordinary people. so I became a 'sacr '.""
He smiled and shook his head: ""It's ironic, isn't it? I steal wine to live, they give medicine to kill people.""
You didn't respond.
""What about you?"" Raine asked.
You hesitated for a moment and replied in a low voice, ""It's the main caller of the poison change case. You will be on the torture table in eleven days.""
The man behind the wall made a short, 1 inhale.
""Eleven days? You haven't even had a formal trial?""
""No.""
""So-"" he paused, ""the day you went to prison, were you recorded? Was there a serial transcription? Was there a proclamation date?""
You recall the sight of that day: the cold bracelet clasped to the wrist, the judgment deacon just coldly reciting a string of 1 numbers,
No proclamation, no seal, no writing.
Ryan whispered, ""&hellip; that's not right.""
His words fall into your mind like a drop of cold water.

You are not a sinner, but the 1 ""result"".","You sneer: ""lock pick, oil, code... you look too prepared.""
The man behind the wall did not answer immediately. Only the light of the ash lamp beat between the cracks in the wall, like some kind of uneasy omen.
""You think I believe you?"" you continued.
""Here, everyone who stretches out his hand has another 1 hidden in the shadow.""
After a moment's silence, he laughed in a low voice.
""Well, pretentious alchemist. When you decide to live, I'm still here.""

Day 5 Trial Chamber,"Before dawn, you were dragged out of the prison door by the jailer.
The chain links rubbed against the slate, leaving a dull echo of the 1 string.
The dome of the trial hall is high and empty, the walls are inlaid with gold inscriptions and emblem reliefs, and the dust floats in the pillars of light, like a slowly falling prayer.
The judge sat behind the curtain of light, holding the 1 bottle of white liquid medicine in his hand.
""E-9, the alchemist, was arrested in a drug-related case. I am asking you to reconfirm: Do you admit to participating in the production and testing of healing agents?""
You did not answer, silent.
The judge sneered: ""mortals dare to use holy medicine as fake medicine. It seems that fire is enough to wash away this arrogance.""
You raise your eyes.
After the crowd, the 1 man in black stood still.
He has no coat of arms, no chains, but he appears clear in the light and shadow between you and the sanctuary.
When you look at him, he slowly raises his hand -3 fingers together, pointing to his heart. Your breathing 1 slightly stagnant.
The judge's voice pressed down again: ""Answer, No. E-9.""",View potion,Look at the man in black.,fainting,"Instead of answering the judge at once, you gazed at the bottle on the table.

Your heart is cold, this is the healing agent that has been ""mixed. Its medicinal properties will quickly freeze blood vessels and inhibit thinking.
You ask tentatively, ""Whose hand did this drug come from?""
The judge raised his eyes: ""From you.""
You heard some of the gods sniggering.
The liquid medicine breathes in the light, and you smell the faint smell of sleeping crow pollen.
-- That's the taste of the mouth of your fellow prisoner who died in prison.","You pretend to be listening to the interrogation, but your eyes stay on the man in black.
The man in black nodded slightly at you after the gesture,
You don't feel uneasy, just 1 a kind of ineffable curiosity.
That's not a threat, it's more like a pact.","You feigned a fainting fit and leaned forward.

The taste is extremely bitter, but it quickly spreads to your throat-after a sharp pain, your limbs regain strength and the magic returns for a short time.
And it is in this neglected gap-you notice that beside the trial table, the texture of the ground stone bricks is subtly different from the common laying method in the prison area.
A very fine ash seam, extending from the trial bench to the corner lamppost, seemed to have been deliberately covered up.

,"Because you didn't plead guilty on the spot, the arraignment ended hastily.
The judge left only a cold order: ""Prepare for the second trial.""
The jailer redeems you to return to prison. The sound of the stone door closing behind, like the last 1 pages of the world falling.
You think it's over.
Until midnight.
The ash lamp flickered, and 1 was an almost inaudible rhythm in the air:
Dong-dong-dong.
The sound came from that side of the wall, just after the third brick.
You lean over and press your ears against the cold stone wall.
The voice had a faint echo: ""Tomorrow... be careful.""
The sound is extremely light, but it seems to echo in your bones.
You immediately think of the gestures of the day -3 fingers, heart, silence.
He knew you would listen. He knows you can understand.
You suddenly realize that it's not a threat, it's a connection.

And that whisper, maybe from hell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Day 6 Mary-El,"Early in the morning, riots broke out in the prison area.
You are awakened by a sudden shock, and the echo of the iron gate being smashed open reverberates between the walls. The smell of fire oil came in along the wind, mixed with scorching and blood.
If it weren't for the voice that reminded you to be careful, you would probably be buried between fire and iron at the moment.
A quarter of an hour later, the riot was suppressed and the chaos dispersed, leaving only the smell of scorched ash and holy oil.
Sister Mariel came slowly with the medicine cabinet.
She examined the wounded one by one, prayed in a low voice, and when she came to you, her eyes paused slightly, as if thinking.
She did not speak, but nodded gently.
""God bless you, survivor.""
The moment she turned, the holy emblem waved in the light.
When you look at the light, a strange uneasiness suddenly rises from the bottom of your heart.

She was slightly startled, then gentle in tone, but with a 1 kind of ceremonial alienation.
""No, it's just that something happened to the medicine refining workshop in the outer district. Recently, their medicines have failed one after another, and some have even been poisoned.""
She spoke lightly, but could not hide the uneasiness in her tone.
""The church has instructed that the folk methods are too crude to be worthy of the name of the holy medicine. They are recalling all the formulas and reviewing them again.""
She paused and added the 1 sentence in a low voice: ""This is the will of the Lord and the safety of believers.""","You walked up silently and handed over the clean cloth.
She gave you a slightly surprised look, but did not refuse, motioning for you to help her mix the holy oil with hemp powder.

You are familiar with this ratio-pain relief cream.
If a few ingredients are missing, the drug will stop the pain but not for long, just what you saw the jailer use before.

As soon as the fire is gone, you quickly approach and stretch out your hand to remove the brick.
A piece of moisture-soaked shredded paper slipped out, and the paper was engraved with an imprint-the symbol of semicircle and triangle overlapping.

Ryan was slightly shocked, then understood what you meant, and a hint of ruthlessness flashed through his eyes.
He kicked the bucket over, the iron crashing into the ground with a harsh noise.
""You animals!"" He screamed, ""Even the dead are not spared? The rioters were burned to ashes last night, don't you think it's enough!""
The torches immediately turned to his side, and the jailers, enraged by the sudden noise, rushed up, yelling, beating, and maintaining order.

It took them a while to subdue Ryan, and one of them cursed impatiently in a low voice: ""Crazy, so noisy that even the holy emblem will be dropped.""
The search ended hastily in chaos.
Ryan was pushed back into the prison, his mouth bloody, but he smiled.
""Remember how you owe me, Refined Medicine,"" he whispered.

He was draped in gray robes, his face hidden between light and shadow. When he looked up, you recognized it.
That's your former colleague-your friend Vera, the alchemist who worked in the Magic Academy.
She was transferred to the Bureau of God and lost contact for several months, but now she is wearing an investigator's robe.
She whispered, ""They want you to die clean, but I can't watch you be made a scapegoat.""

""I don't have much time. They already suspect me, but I can help you get out of here. Whatever you want, I'll do my best-but don't ask too much.""

He took out the 1 contract: ""The Lord will have mercy on sinners who know how to repent. Since confession-then sign the ban on civilian pharmacists for the church and become living evidence.""
He opened 1 pages of documents, on which were impressively the registers and seals of civilian refined pharmacists.
""Have these people worked with you? Their sins are also connected with you.""
He held out his feather pen and wrote an order under the list.
You vaguely see the last line of the handwriting: ""Execute the burning order today.""

""Unbridled-"" He rose sharply, the emblem banging against his chest and making a heavy sound.
""Who do you think you are? The blessing of God is not in your blood, nor in your hands. You steal the magic and defile the code of law... You think that medicine can save people? It will only create more heretics!""
His emotions suddenly spiralled out of control, the flames beating wildly behind him, the light and shadow of the candlestick twisting into a twisted icon on the wall.

""The precipitation of that bottle of healing agent is wrong. After the ratio of sleeping crow pollen is out of balance, blood coagulation and respiratory arrest will be caused. This is not the mistake of refining pharmacists, but someone deliberately did it.""
The interrogation hall fell silent. The candles flickered and the air seemed to freeze.

""If not, you will also be responsible for the death of more people. Let us live first and then fight for the truth.""
She hesitated. Eventually she hid her face back into the wide cloak and whispered, ""I'll think of something.","You are silent. The lights stretched her face, and the bells outside the walls chilled like a metronome.

You rushed out of the ventilation shaft and crawled along the hot iron vein.

Ryan was stunned for a moment, his eyes flashing,

""I'm afraid of dying in vain."" You whisper.
He sneered, turned around and pulled the rusty iron hook from under the bed board.
""Then it depends on whether I can live longer than you.""
He squatted in front of the iron door and began to pick the lock.
The sound of chains rubbing was particularly harsh in the silent prison area. You didn't stop it.
After a long while, the 1 sound of the lock ""click"" was disconnected.
Ryan looks at you, with sarcasm in his eyes.
""If I get out alive, I will tell them that you taught me to make the medicine.""
You didn't respond. Just watch him disappear into the shadows of the hallway. The night swallowed his steps.

""Another alchemist,"" he whispered, ""died in his own medicine and dreams.""
There is no cause of your death on the announcement, only 1 cold conclusion:
""E-9 has returned to silence.""
The ashes are not divided into each other, and the blood and wisdom of mortals will eventually return to the same kind of dust.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
